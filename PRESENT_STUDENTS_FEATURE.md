# Present Students Feature - Implementation Guide

## Overview

This feature filters the student list to show only **present students** for the current day by excluding students marked as absent in the `Absence_Child` table.

## Database Changes

### Updated `Absence_Child` Table Schema

```prisma
model Absence_Child {
  absent_id Int      @id @default(autoincrement())
  childId   Int
  child     Child    @relation("AbsentChildren", fields: [childId], references: [child_id])
  date      DateTime @default(now()) @db.Date
  reason    String
  createdAt DateTime @default(now())

  @@index([childId])
  @@index([date])
  @@unique([childId, date])  // Ensures a child can only be marked absent once per day
}
```

**New Fields:**

- `childId` - Foreign key to the Child table
- `date` - Date of absence (indexed for fast queries)
- Unique constraint on `[childId, date]` to prevent duplicate entries

### Updated `Child` Model

Added relation to absences:

```prisma
model Child {
  // ... existing fields
  absences       Absence_Child[]  @relation("AbsentChildren")
}
```

## Backend Changes

### `child-ride-request.service.ts`

**Updated Logic:**

1. ✅ Fetches all assigned students for the driver (`status = 'Assigned'`)
2. ✅ Queries `Absence_Child` table for today's absent students
3. ✅ Filters out absent students from the assigned list
4. ✅ Returns only present students

```typescript
async getRequestsForDriver(driverId: number) {
  // Get today's date range
  const today = new Date();
  today.setHours(0, 0, 0, 0);
  const tomorrow = new Date(today);
  tomorrow.setDate(tomorrow.getDate() + 1);

  // Fetch assigned students
  const assignedRequests = await this.prisma.childRideRequest.findMany({
    where: {
      driverId,
      status: 'Assigned'
    },
    include: { child: { ... } }
  });

  // Get today's absent children
  const absentChildren = await this.prisma.absence_Child.findMany({
    where: {
      date: { gte: today, lt: tomorrow }
    }
  });

  // Filter out absent children
  const absentChildIds = new Set(absentChildren.map(a => a.childId));
  return assignedRequests.filter(req => !absentChildIds.has(req.child.child_id));
}
```

## Frontend Changes

### `mobile-driver/app/(tabs)/index.tsx`

**What Changed:**

- Now uses authenticated API call
- Student count automatically reflects **present students only**

**Display:**

```tsx
<Typography variant="title-2" weight="bold">
  {studentCount} Students {/* Shows only present students */}
</Typography>
```

### `mobile-driver/app/(tabs)/current-students.tsx`

**What Changed:**

- ✅ Updated to use `tokenService.createAuthenticatedFetch()`
- ✅ Added proper error handling
- ✅ Student list automatically shows **present students only**

**Display:**

```tsx
<Typography variant="body">
  {filteredStudents.length} students found {/* Present students */}
</Typography>
```

## How It Works - Flow Diagram

```
Driver Login
    ↓
Home Screen / Current Students Screen
    ↓
API Call: GET /driver/child-ride-requests
    ↓
Backend Service:
    1. Get Assigned Students (status = 'Assigned')
    2. Get Absent Students for Today
    3. Filter: Assigned - Absent = Present
    ↓
Return Present Students Only
    ↓
Display in App:
    - Home: Show count of present students
    - Current Students: Show list of present students
```

## Database Migration Steps

**To apply the schema changes:**

```bash
cd backend
npx prisma db push
```

**Note:** You'll see a warning about adding a unique constraint. Accept it by typing `y` when prompted.

## Testing the Feature

### 1. Test Present Students (Normal Case)

**Setup:**

- Driver ID: 1
- Assigned students: Child 1, Child 2, Child 3
- No absences for today

**Expected Result:**

- Home screen shows: "3 Students"
- Current Students screen shows all 3 children

### 2. Test with Absences

**Setup:**

- Driver ID: 1
- Assigned students: Child 1, Child 2, Child 3
- Absent today: Child 2

**Expected Result:**

- Home screen shows: "2 Students"
- Current Students screen shows: Child 1, Child 3 (Child 2 hidden)

### 3. Test Date Filtering

**Setup:**

- Driver ID: 1
- Assigned students: Child 1, Child 2
- Child 1 absent yesterday
- Child 2 absent today

**Expected Result:**

- Home screen shows: "1 Student" (only Child 1, since yesterday's absence doesn't count)
- Current Students screen shows: Child 1

## API Endpoint Details

### `GET /driver/child-ride-requests`

**Authentication:** Required (JWT Bearer Token)

**Response Format:**

```json
[
  {
    "child": {
      "child_id": 1,
      "childFirstName": "John",
      "childLastName": "Doe",
      "nearbyCity": "Colombo"
    },
    "status": "Assigned",
    "driverId": 1
  }
]
```

**Note:** This endpoint now automatically filters out absent children for the current day.

## How to Mark a Child as Absent

To mark a child as absent for today, insert a record into `Absence_Child`:

```sql
INSERT INTO "Absence_Child" ("childId", "date", "reason")
VALUES (123, CURRENT_DATE, 'Sick');
```

Or via Prisma:

```typescript
await prisma.absence_Child.create({
  data: {
    childId: 123,
    date: new Date(),
    reason: "Sick",
  },
});
```

## Performance Considerations

### Optimizations Applied:

1. ✅ **Indexed Fields:** `childId` and `date` are indexed for fast lookups
2. ✅ **Set-based Filtering:** Uses JavaScript `Set` for O(1) lookup time
3. ✅ **Date Range Query:** Efficient date comparison using `gte` and `lt`

### Expected Query Performance:

- Get assigned students: ~10-50ms
- Get today's absences: ~5-10ms
- Filter logic: ~1-2ms
- **Total:** ~15-60ms (very fast)

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements:

1. **Absence Notifications:** Alert driver when a child is marked absent
2. **Bulk Absence Entry:** Allow marking multiple children absent at once
3. **Absence History:** View past absences for a child
4. **Absence Patterns:** Analytics showing absence trends
5. **Parent Notification:** Auto-notify parents when their child is marked absent

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Student count doesn't match expected

**Check:**

1. Are students assigned to the correct driver?
2. Is the absence record for today's date?
3. Is the child ID in the absence record correct?

**Debug Query:**

```sql
-- Check assigned students for driver
SELECT * FROM "ChildRideRequest"
WHERE "driverId" = 1 AND status = 'Assigned';

-- Check today's absences
SELECT * FROM "Absence_Child"
WHERE date = CURRENT_DATE;
```

### Issue: Schema migration fails

**Solution:**
If you have existing data in `Absence_Child` without `childId`, you'll need to clean it first:

```sql
-- Backup and clear existing records
DELETE FROM "Absence_Child";
```

Then run `npx prisma db push` again.
