# Find Vehicle Feature Implementation

## Overview
Implemented a complete find-vehicle feature that allows customers to search for suitable drivers based on their pickup and drop-off locations. The system uses geospatial calculations to match drivers whose routes pass within a configurable radius of the customer's locations.

## Backend Implementation

### 1. Module Structure
Created a new `find-vehicle` module in the backend with the following files:

```
backend/src/find-vehicle/
├── dto/
│   ├── search-vehicle.dto.ts       # Request DTO for search
│   ├── vehicle-search-response.dto.ts  # Response DTO
│   └── index.ts                    # Barrel export
├── find-vehicle.controller.ts      # API endpoints
├── find-vehicle.service.ts         # Business logic
└── find-vehicle.module.ts          # Module definition
```

### 2. Key Features

#### Search Algorithm (Point-to-Line Distance)
- Uses **Turf.js** (@turf/turf) for professional geospatial calculations
- **Point-to-Line Distance**: Calculates perpendicular distance from customer location to driver's route path
- **Route Path Analysis**: Considers actual route segments, not just city centers
- **Direction Validation**: Ensures drop-off segment comes after pickup segment in route order
- **Threshold**: Searches within **10 km radius** from the route path
- Filters by vehicle type, minimum rating, and ride type (School/Work)

**How it works:**
1. Builds driver's route as a polyline (connected segments between cities)
2. For pickup point: Finds nearest route segment and calculates perpendicular distance
3. For drop point: Finds nearest route segment and calculates perpendicular distance
4. Validates: Both points within 10km AND drop segment after pickup segment
5. Returns only suitable drivers with actual distances

#### API Endpoints

**1. Search Vehicles**
```
GET /find-vehicle/search
Query Parameters:
  - customerId: number (required)
  - profileType: 'child' | 'staff' (optional)
  - profileId: number (optional)
  - vehicleType: string (optional, e.g., 'Van', 'Bus')
  - minRating: number (optional, 0-5)
```

**2. Get Customer Profiles**
```
GET /find-vehicle/profiles
Query Parameters:
  - customerId: number (required)
```

### 3. Data Structure

The service queries:
- **Customer** table (with children and staff_passenger relations)
- **Driver** table (with driverCities and vehicles relations)
- **City** table (for coordinate mapping)
- **DriverCities** table (for route information and display times)

**Important Note about Time Fields:**
- `usualStartTime` and `usualEndTime` in `DriverCities` are TIME fields (`@db.Time(6)`)
- These are **display-only** fields showing the driver's usual schedule (e.g., "06:00", "16:00")
- **NOT used** for calculations, filtering, or matching
- Formatted as `HH:MM` strings in the API response

### 4. Response Data

Each vehicle result includes:
- Driver information (ID, name, phone, rating)
- Vehicle details (ID, type, brand, model, registration, seats, amenities)
- Route information (start city, end city, all route cities)
- Distance metrics (from pickup and drop locations)
- Estimated times (pickup and drop-off)

## Frontend Implementation

### 1. Updated UI (`find_vehicle.tsx`)

**Removed:**
- Pickup location input field
- Drop-off location input field
- Pickup time input field
- Drop-off time input field

**Kept:**
- Vehicle type filter (Van/Bus/All)
- Minimum rating filter (1-5 stars)

**Added:**
- Loading indicator while searching
- Empty state when no vehicles found
- Real-time data from backend API
- Error handling with user-friendly alerts

### 2. API Integration (`lib/api/find-vehicle.ts`)

Created a new API service module with:
- Type definitions for requests and responses
- `searchVehicles()` function to fetch matching drivers
- `getCustomerProfiles()` function to retrieve customer data
- Proper error handling and type safety

### 3. Data Flow

1. Component loads and fetches customer data from AsyncStorage
2. Automatically searches for vehicles based on stored profile
3. Updates results when filters change (vehicle type, rating)
4. Displays vehicles sorted by proximity to pickup location

## Database Requirements

### Required Data in Database

1. **Customer profiles must have coordinates:**
   - Child: `pickupLatitude`, `pickupLongitude`, `schoolLatitude`, `schoolLongitude`
   - Staff: `pickupLatitude`, `pickupLongitude`, `workLatitude`, `workLongitude`

2. **Cities table must be populated:**
   - City ID, name, latitude, longitude
   - **Important**: Cities must be in the correct order in driver routes

3. **Drivers must have:**
   - Active status and HAVING_A_PROFILE registration status
   - DriverCities entry with **ordered array** of city IDs (route order matters!)
   - usualStartTime and usualEndTime (optional, for display)
   - At least one assigned vehicle
   - **Minimum 2 cities** in route to form a valid path

### Dependencies

```json
{
  "@turf/turf": "^7.x.x"  // Geospatial calculations
}
```

Install with:
```bash
npm install @turf/turf
```

## How to Test

### Backend Testing

1. **Start the backend server:**
```bash
cd backend
npm run start:dev
```

2. **Test the search endpoint:**
```bash
curl "http://localhost:3000/find-vehicle/search?customerId=1&profileType=child&profileId=1&vehicleType=Van&minRating=4"
```

3. **Test the profiles endpoint:**
```bash
curl "http://localhost:3000/find-vehicle/profiles?customerId=1"
```

### Frontend Testing

1. **Ensure customer is logged in** with:
   - Valid customer ID in AsyncStorage
   - Active profile type ('child' or 'staff')
   - Active profile ID

2. **Navigate to Find Vehicle screen**

3. **Test filters:**
   - Change vehicle type (All/Van/Bus)
   - Adjust minimum rating (1-5 stars)
   - Verify results update automatically

## Configuration

### Adjustable Parameters

In `find-vehicle.service.ts`:
```typescript
const RADIUS_KM = 10; // Search radius - can be adjusted
```

### AsyncStorage Keys

The frontend expects these keys:
- `customerId`: Customer's ID
- `activeProfileType`: 'child' or 'staff'
- `activeProfileId`: Child ID or Staff Passenger ID

## Important Notes

1. **Coordinate Data Required:** Customers must have their pickup and destination coordinates stored in the database. Without these, the search will fail.

2. **City Data:** The City table must be populated with main cities and their coordinates for the route path algorithm to work.

3. **Driver Routes:** 
   - Drivers must have their route cities configured in the DriverCities table
   - **City order matters!** Cities must be in the actual travel sequence
   - Need at least 2 cities to form a route path
   - Example: `[1, 2, 3, 4]` means route goes 1→2→3→4

4. **Rating Placeholder:** The current implementation uses a placeholder rating (4.5) for drivers. You'll need to implement actual rating calculations based on reviews.

5. **Distance Calculation:** The system uses Turf.js point-to-line distance which calculates the perpendicular distance from a point to the nearest segment on the route. This is much more accurate than simple point-to-point distance.

6. **Direction Validation:** The algorithm ensures customers are picked up before being dropped off by checking segment indices. This prevents matching drivers traveling in the wrong direction.

7. **Threshold:** The 10km threshold is configurable in the service file. Adjust based on your service area (urban vs rural).

## Future Enhancements

1. **Real-time Availability:** Integrate with driver's current availability status
2. **Price Estimation:** Add fare calculation based on distance
3. **Advanced Filtering:** Add filters for amenities (AC, assistant)
4. **Booking Integration:** Allow direct booking from search results
5. **Map View:** Show driver routes and customer locations on a map
6. **Rating System:** Implement actual driver rating aggregation
7. **Notifications:** Notify customers when new drivers become available in their area
