# Real-Time Driver Location Tracking - Complete Implementation

## Overview

This document describes the complete implementation of real-time driver location tracking that allows customers to see their driver's live location during active rides.

## How It Works

### Driver Side (Mobile-Driver App)

1. **Driver starts morning or evening route** by clicking "Start Morning Route" or "Start Evening Route"
2. **Location tracking automatically starts** when the route is fetched
3. **Driver's location is broadcasted** every 10 seconds via WebSocket to all subscribed customers
4. **Tracking stops** when the driver completes all stops and the route ends
5. **Visual indicators** show the driver that location sharing is active

### Customer Side (Mobile-Customer App)

1. **Customer opens Navigate tab** with an active profile selected (child or staff)
2. **App checks for assigned driver** and active route
3. **If driver has started their route**, customer subscribes to location updates
4. **Driver's live location appears on the map** with real-time updates
5. **Connection status** is displayed to the customer

---

## Architecture

### Backend Components

#### 1. WebSocket Gateway (`driver-location.gateway.ts`)
**Location**: `backend/src/driver-location/driver-location.gateway.ts`

**Events Emitted by Driver**:
- `startRide` - Driver starts a ride (begins location sharing)
- `updateLocation` - Driver sends location update (every 10 seconds)
- `endRide` - Driver ends a ride (stops location sharing)

**Events Emitted by Customer**:
- `subscribeToRoute` - Customer subscribes to receive location updates for a route
- `unsubscribeFromRoute` - Customer unsubscribes from route updates

**Broadcasts to Customers**:
- `rideStarted` - Notifies customers that driver has started
- `driverLocationUpdated` - Real-time location updates
- `rideEnded` - Notifies customers that driver has ended the ride

**WebSocket URL**: `ws://your-api-url/driver-location`

#### 2. Location Service (`driver-location.service.ts`)
**Location**: `backend/src/driver-location/driver-location.service.ts`

**Key Responsibilities**:
- Track active rides in memory (Map of routeId ‚Üí ride data)
- Validate location updates (gatekeeper pattern)
- Manage customer subscriptions
- Clean up stale rides automatically

**In-Memory State**:
```typescript
activeRides: Map<routeId, {
  driverId: string;
  startTime: Date;
  lastUpdate: Date;
  latitude: number;
  longitude: number;
}>
```

#### 3. Route API Endpoint
**New Endpoint**: `GET /driver/route/active/:driverId`
**Location**: `backend/src/driver-route/driver-route.controller.ts`

**Purpose**: Allow customers to find the active route ID for their driver

**Response**:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "activeRoute": {
    "routeId": 123,
    "routeType": "MORNING_PICKUP",
    "status": "IN_PROGRESS"
  }
}
```

**Response (No Active Route)**:
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "message": "No active route found for this driver",
  "activeRoute": null
}
```

### Frontend Components

#### Driver App (`mobile-driver`)

**File**: `mobile-driver/app/(tabs)/navigation.tsx`

**Key Features**:
- Integrated location tracking in `handleStartRide` function
- Automatic start when route is fetched
- Automatic stop when all stops are completed
- Real-time connection status display
- Update counter showing number of location broadcasts

**Location Service**: `mobile-driver/lib/services/driver-location.service.ts`

**How It Works**:
1. When driver clicks "Start Morning/Evening Route":
   ```typescript
   const routeData = await routeApi.getTodaysRoute(...);
   await driverLocationService.startLocationTracking({
     driverId: profile.id.toString(),
     routeId: routeData.route.id.toString(),
     onLocationUpdate: (location) => { ... },
     onError: (error) => { ... },
     onRideStarted: () => { ... },
     onRideEnded: () => { ... },
   });
   ```

2. Location updates sent every 10 seconds:
   ```typescript
   socket.emit('updateLocation', {
     driverId,
     routeId,
     latitude,
     longitude,
     heading,
     speed,
     accuracy,
   });
   ```

3. When all stops completed:
   ```typescript
   await driverLocationService.stopLocationTracking();
   ```

**UI Indicators**:
- üü¢ Green pulsing dot + "Live (X updates)" = Tracking active
- üü° Yellow dot + "Not tracking" = Ride active but tracking failed

#### Customer App (`mobile-customer`)

**File**: `mobile-customer/app/(tabs)/navigate.tsx`

**Key Features**:
- Automatic detection of assigned driver
- Fetches active route ID from backend
- Subscribes to driver location updates
- Displays driver on map with real-time movement
- Shows connection status and ride state

**Location Service**: `mobile-customer/lib/services/customer-location.service.ts`

**How It Works**:
1. When navigate tab opens with active profile:
   ```typescript
   const ride = await assignedRideApi.getAssignedChildRide(childId);
   const routeData = await fetch(`/driver/route/active/${ride.driverId}`);
   const routeId = routeData.activeRoute.routeId.toString();
   ```

2. Subscribe to route updates:
   ```typescript
   await customerLocationService.connect({ ... });
   await customerLocationService.subscribeToRoute(routeId, customerId);
   ```

3. Receive location updates:
   ```typescript
   onLocationUpdate: (location) => {
     setDriverLocation(location);
     // Update map to show driver
   }
   ```

**Map Features**:
- üìç Blue marker = Customer location
- üöó Green car marker = Driver location (rotates with heading)
- Dotted line connecting customer and driver
- Auto-zoom to fit both markers

---

## Database Schema

No additional tables required! The existing schema supports this feature:

**DriverRoute Table** (already exists):
- `id` - Used as routeId for WebSocket subscriptions
- `driverId` - Links to driver
- `status` - 'IN_PROGRESS' indicates active tracking
- `date` - Today's date for filtering
- `routeType` - 'MORNING_PICKUP' or 'AFTERNOON_DROPOFF'

## Testing Guide

### Prerequisites

1. **Backend running** on http://localhost:3000 (or your configured URL)
2. **Driver app** running on physical device or emulator
3. **Customer app** running on physical device or emulator
4. **Test data**:
   - Driver account with verified status
   - Customer account with child/staff profile
   - Assigned ride request (driver assigned to child/staff)
   - At least one child with pickup/dropoff locations

### Step-by-Step Testing

#### Setup Phase

1. **Create Test Driver Account**
   - Register driver via mobile-driver app
   - Complete profile with vehicle details
   - Ensure verification status is approved

2. **Create Test Customer Account**
   - Register customer via mobile-customer app
   - Create child profile with pickup/dropoff locations
   - Or create staff profile

3. **Create Ride Assignment**
   - Customer requests ride
   - Driver accepts request
   - Admin/system assigns the request

4. **Verify Assignment**
   - Customer app should show assigned driver on home screen
   - Driver app should show assigned children/staff

#### Test Scenario 1: Morning Route Tracking

**Driver Side**:
1. Open mobile-driver app
2. Navigate to "Navigation" tab
3. Click "Start Morning Route"
4. Wait for route to load
5. ‚úÖ **Verify**: Header shows "üü¢ Live (X updates)" status
6. ‚úÖ **Verify**: Console logs show "‚úÖ Location tracking started successfully"
7. Start completing stops one by one

**Customer Side** (simultaneously):
1. Open mobile-customer app
2. Select the child/staff profile assigned to this driver
3. Navigate to "Navigate" tab
4. ‚úÖ **Verify**: Driver location appears on map as green car marker
5. ‚úÖ **Verify**: Info card shows "Driver on the way" with "Live" indicator
6. ‚úÖ **Verify**: Driver marker moves in real-time as driver moves
7. Watch as driver completes route

**Expected Behavior**:
- Customer sees driver's marker update every 10 seconds
- Map auto-zooms to show both customer and driver
- Dotted line connects customer to driver
- When driver completes last stop:
  - Driver app shows "üèÅ Ride Complete!"
  - Customer app shows "Driver has ended the ride"
  - Driver marker disappears from customer's map

#### Test Scenario 2: Evening Route Tracking

**Prerequisites**: Morning route must be completed first

**Driver Side**:
1. Complete morning route if not already done
2. Click "Start Evening Route"
3. ‚úÖ **Verify**: Location tracking starts again
4. ‚úÖ **Verify**: New route ID is used for evening session

**Customer Side**:
1. Customer should already be on Navigate tab
2. ‚úÖ **Verify**: App automatically subscribes to new route
3. ‚úÖ **Verify**: Location tracking continues seamlessly

#### Test Scenario 3: Connection Recovery

**Test**: What happens if connection is lost?

**Driver Side**:
1. Start a route as normal
2. Turn off WiFi/data briefly (5 seconds)
3. Turn it back on
4. ‚úÖ **Verify**: Connection auto-recovers
5. ‚úÖ **Verify**: Location updates resume

**Customer Side**:
1. Observing driver location
2. Driver loses connection
3. ‚úÖ **Verify**: Last known location remains on map
4. When driver reconnects:
5. ‚úÖ **Verify**: Updates resume automatically

#### Test Scenario 4: Late Customer Join

**Test**: Customer opens app after driver already started

**Steps**:
1. Driver starts route and is already in progress
2. Customer opens app and goes to Navigate tab
3. ‚úÖ **Verify**: Customer immediately receives current driver location
4. ‚úÖ **Verify**: Info card shows "Driver on the way" with "Live" status

#### Test Scenario 5: Multiple Customers

**Test**: Multiple children assigned to same driver

**Setup**: Assign 2+ children to the same driver

**Steps**:
1. Driver starts route
2. Open customer app on Device A (Child 1's profile)
3. Open customer app on Device B (Child 2's profile)
4. ‚úÖ **Verify**: Both devices show driver location
5. ‚úÖ **Verify**: Both receive real-time updates
6. Driver completes route
7. ‚úÖ **Verify**: Both devices receive "Ride ended" notification

### Console Log Verification

**Driver App Console**:
```
üöÄ Starting location tracking...
‚úÖ Location tracking started successfully
üìç Location updated (1 updates)
üìç Location updated (2 updates)
...
üèÅ All stops completed - stopping location tracking
‚úÖ Location tracking stopped successfully
```

**Customer App Console**:
```
üì° Fetching active route for driver ID: 7
‚úÖ Found active route: { routeId: 123, ... }
‚úÖ Connected to location tracking server
üì° Subscribing to route 123...
‚úÖ Subscribed to route 123
üìç Driver location updated: { latitude: 6.92, longitude: 79.86, ... }
üìç Driver location updated: { latitude: 6.93, longitude: 79.87, ... }
...
üõë Ride ended: { routeId: 123, status: 'ENDED', ... }
```

### Troubleshooting

#### Driver Location Not Showing on Customer App

**Check**:
1. Is driver route actually started? (Check driver app header for green dot)
2. Is customer profile assigned to this driver?
3. Check browser/app console for errors
4. Verify WebSocket connection:
   ```
   curl http://localhost:3000/driver/route/active/[driverId]
   ```
5. Check if route status is 'IN_PROGRESS' in database

#### Location Updates Stopping

**Check**:
1. Driver's device location permissions
2. Network connectivity
3. Backend server still running
4. Check for console errors
5. Verify route hasn't been marked as completed

#### Customer Can't Subscribe

**Check**:
1. WebSocket server running on correct port
2. CORS configuration allows customer domain
3. Route ID is correct
4. Check network tab for WebSocket connection

## Key Implementation Details

### Gatekeeper Pattern

The backend service acts as a "gatekeeper" for location broadcasts:

```typescript
// Only broadcast if ride is active
const { shouldBroadcast, activeRide } = 
  locationService.updateLocation(driverId, routeId, lat, lng);

if (!shouldBroadcast) {
  return; // Silently ignore
}

// Broadcast to customers
server.to(routeId).emit('driverLocationUpdated', locationData);
```

This ensures customers only receive updates during active rides.

### Room-Based Broadcasting

WebSocket rooms are used for efficient broadcasting:

- Each route has its own room (room ID = route ID)
- Driver joins their route room when starting
- Customers join the room when subscribing
- Updates are broadcast to the room, not individual sockets

```typescript
// Driver joins
client.join(routeId);

// Customer joins
client.join(routeId);

// Broadcast to all in room
server.to(routeId).emit('driverLocationUpdated', data);
```

### Automatic Cleanup

Stale rides are automatically cleaned up:

```typescript
// Runs every 30 minutes
setInterval(() => {
  const cleaned = locationService.cleanupStaleRides();
}, 30 * 60 * 1000);
```

Rides inactive for > 1 hour are removed from memory.

## Performance Considerations

### Update Frequency

- **10 seconds** between location updates (configurable)
- **10 meters** minimum distance change before update
- Balance between real-time accuracy and battery/data usage

### Memory Usage

- Active rides stored in-memory (Map)
- Automatic cleanup of stale rides
- Subscription tracking per route

### Network Usage

- WebSocket maintains single persistent connection
- Binary-efficient Socket.IO protocol
- Only active customers receive updates (room-based)

---

## Security Considerations

### Authentication

- Driver and customer JWT tokens validated for API calls
- WebSocket connections are public (no auth on socket connect)
- Route subscription is open (customers can subscribe to any route by ID)

### Privacy

- Location only shared during active rides
- Automatic stop when ride ends
- Customers only see their assigned driver
- No location history stored

### Rate Limiting

Consider adding:
- Maximum update frequency per driver
- Maximum subscriptions per customer
- Connection throttling

---

## Future Enhancements

### Possible Improvements

1. **Offline Support**
   - Queue location updates when offline
   - Send batch when reconnected

2. **Location History**
   - Store route polyline in database
   - Show customer the path driver took

3. **ETA Calculation**
   - Calculate real-time ETA to customer
   - Update as driver progresses

4. **Notifications**
   - Push notification when driver is X minutes away
   - Alert when driver arrives

5. **Analytics**
   - Track average route duration
   - Monitor driver speed/behavior
   - Route efficiency metrics

6. **Admin Dashboard**
   - Real-time map showing all active drivers
   - Monitor tracking health
   - View active routes
