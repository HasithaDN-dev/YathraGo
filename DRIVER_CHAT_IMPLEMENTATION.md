# Mobile Driver Chat Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented a complete chat system for the mobile-driver app, mirroring the functionality of the mobile-customer chat frontend. The implementation includes conversation list, individual chat rooms with text and image support, and proper navigation.

## Files Created/Modified

### 1. New UI Component
- **`components/ui/ScreenHeader.tsx`**
  - Copied from mobile-customer and adapted for driver app
  - Provides consistent header with back navigation across chat screens

### 2. Chat Screens
- **`app/(tabs)/chat_list.tsx`**
  - Lists all conversations for the driver
  - Shows unread message counts with blue badges
  - Supports pull-to-refresh and auto-polling (every 5 seconds)
  - Search functionality to filter conversations
  - Displays participant avatars with fallback to default image
  
- **`app/(tabs)/chat_room.tsx`**
  - Individual chat room with message history
  - Text message support
  - Image upload (camera & gallery) support
  - Message status indicators (sent ‚úì, delivered ‚úì‚úì, seen ‚úì‚úì blue)
  - Auto-scroll to new messages
  - Pull-to-refresh and auto-polling (every 3 seconds)
  - Mark messages as seen automatically when viewing
  - Keyboard-aware input toolbar

### 3. Navigation Update
- **`app/(tabs)/index.tsx`**
  - Updated "Message" quick action card to navigate to chat_list
  - Added `onPress` handler: `router.push('/(tabs)/chat_list')`

### 4. Assets
- **`assets/images/profile_Picture.png`**
  - Copied from mobile-customer for consistent default avatar

## Key Differences from Customer Frontend

### Simplified Actor Logic
- **Customer app**: Supports multiple profiles (parent CUSTOMER + activeProfile which can be child/staff)
- **Driver app**: Single profile (DRIVER only)
  - Uses `user.id` and `userType: 'DRIVER'` consistently
  - No profile switching needed
  - Removed `getCurrentActor()` complexity where child/staff logic was present

### API Integration
All endpoints match the backend chat API:
- `GET /chat/conversations?userId={id}&userType=DRIVER` - List conversations
- `GET /chat/conversations/:id/messages` - Get messages for conversation
- `POST /chat/messages` - Send text or image message
- `POST /chat/conversations/:id/mark-seen` - Mark messages as seen
- `POST /chat/upload-image` - Upload image (multipart/form-data)

### Data Flow
1. **Fetching conversations**: Driver ID from `useAuthStore().user.id`
2. **Sending messages**: Always uses `senderType: 'DRIVER'` and `senderId: user.id`
3. **Counting unread**: Filters messages where `!(senderId === user.id && senderType === 'DRIVER') && !seen`
4. **Avatar URLs**: Resolves relative paths to absolute using `API_BASE_URL`

## Features Implemented

### Chat List Screen
‚úÖ Display all driver conversations sorted by most recent  
‚úÖ Show last message preview (text or üì∑ for images)  
‚úÖ Unread message count badges (blue, shows 99+ if >99)  
‚úÖ Search/filter conversations by participant name  
‚úÖ Pull-to-refresh  
‚úÖ Auto-refresh every 5 seconds when screen is focused  
‚úÖ Navigate to chat room on conversation tap  

### Chat Room Screen
‚úÖ Display message history (text + images)  
‚úÖ Send text messages  
‚úÖ Send images (camera capture or gallery pick)  
‚úÖ Image caching for performance  
‚úÖ Message status indicators (sent/delivered/seen)  
‚úÖ Optimistic UI updates when sending images  
‚úÖ Auto-scroll to newest messages  
‚úÖ Mark messages as seen automatically  
‚úÖ Pull-to-refresh  
‚úÖ Auto-refresh every 3 seconds when focused  
‚úÖ Keyboard-aware input toolbar  
‚úÖ Phone call button in header  
‚úÖ Special rendering for thumbs-up emoji (üëç)  

## Technical Implementation Details

### State Management
- Uses `useAuthStore` from `lib/stores/auth.store` for driver profile
- Local state for messages, loading, refreshing, keyboard visibility

### Polling Strategy
- Chat list: 5-second interval using `useFocusEffect`
- Chat room: 3-second interval using `useFocusEffect`
- Cleans up intervals on screen blur/unmount

### Image Handling
- Uses expo-image-picker for camera & gallery access
- Image caching with FileSystem API to avoid re-downloads
- FormData upload with proper MIME type detection
- Optimistic UI updates with rollback on failure

### Error Handling
- Network connectivity test before image upload
- User-friendly error alerts for permissions and failures
- Graceful fallbacks for missing avatars

## Dependencies Used
All dependencies already present in mobile-driver:
- expo-router (navigation)
- expo-image-picker (camera & gallery)
- expo-file-system (image caching)
- phosphor-react-native (icons)
- react-native-safe-area-context (safe areas)
- zustand (state management)

## Testing Checklist

### Basic Functionality
- [ ] Message card in home screen navigates to chat list
- [ ] Chat list displays existing conversations
- [ ] Tapping conversation opens chat room
- [ ] Can send text messages
- [ ] Can capture and send images with camera
- [ ] Can select and send images from gallery
- [ ] Messages display correctly (text + images)
- [ ] Unread badges show correct counts
- [ ] Search filters conversations

### Real-time Updates
- [ ] New messages appear automatically (polling)
- [ ] Unread counts update when messages arrive
- [ ] Messages marked as seen when viewing conversation
- [ ] Pull-to-refresh works on both screens

### Edge Cases
- [ ] Works when no conversations exist
- [ ] Handles network errors gracefully
- [ ] Camera/gallery permission prompts work
- [ ] Keyboard doesn't cover input toolbar
- [ ] Large images upload successfully
- [ ] Long messages wrap correctly

## API Configuration
Ensure `.env` file in mobile-driver has:
```
EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://your-backend-url:3000
```

## Known Limitations
1. No real-time push notifications (relies on polling)
2. No typing indicators
3. No message deletion/editing
4. No file attachments (only images)
5. No message reactions beyond thumbs-up emoji special handling

## Future Enhancements
- Add WebSocket support for real-time updates (eliminate polling)
- Implement push notifications for new messages
- Add typing indicators
- Support video/document attachments
- Add message reactions UI
- Implement message deletion
- Add conversation archiving/muting
- Profile picture tap to view full-screen
- Image tap to view full-screen with zoom

## Maintenance Notes
- Keep polling intervals in sync with backend performance
- Monitor image cache size (consider cleanup policy)
- Update API_BASE_URL when deploying backend
- Ensure backend CORS allows multipart/form-data uploads
- Keep Driver type in sync with backend schema (currently uses `id` field)
