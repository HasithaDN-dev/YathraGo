- View payment status for the current month
- See the next 5 months that need payment
- Select multiple months to pay physically
- Submit selected months to driver for confirmation
- Toggle between card and physical payment options

---

## 🎯 Backend Endpoints Used

### 1. **GET** `/transactions/payable-months/:childid`
**Purpose**: Get the next 5 months with payment status for a child

**Response**:
```json
{
  "months": [
    {
      "year": 2025,
      "month": 10,
      "paymentStatus": "OVERDUE"
    },
    {
      "year": 2025,
      "month": 11,
      "paymentStatus": "NOT_CREATED"
    }
    // ... 3 more months
  ],
  "currentMonth": {
    "year": 2025,
    "month": 10,
    "paymentStatus": "OVERDUE"
  }
}
```

**Status Values**:
- `PAID` - Payment completed
- `OVERDUE` - Payment is overdue (0-1 months from last paid)
- `GRACE_PERIOD` - In grace period (2-3 months from last paid)
- `CANCELLED` - Cancelled (>3 months from last paid)
- `AWAITING_CONFIRMATION` - Submitted, waiting for driver confirmation
- `NOT_DUE` - Not yet due
- `PENDING` - Pending payment
- `NOT_CREATED` - Record not created yet

---

### 2. **POST** `/transactions/submit-for-confirmation`
**Purpose**: Submit selected months for physical payment confirmation

**Request Body**:
```json
{
  "childId": 5,
  "months": [
    { "year": 2025, "month": 10 },
    { "year": 2025, "month": 11 }
  ]
}
```

**Response**:
```json
{
  "message": "Submission successful. 1 records updated, 1 new records created. All are awaiting driver confirmation."
}
```

**Behavior**:
- Updates existing records to `AWAITING_CONFIRMATION`
- Creates missing records with `AWAITING_CONFIRMATION` status
- Prevents duplicate submissions
- Blocks already paid/cancelled/awaiting months

## 🎨 UI Features

### 1. **Payment Type Toggle**
```

└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Color Mapping**:
- 🟢 `PAID` → Green (`bg-success`)

- ⚫ `CANCELLED` → Gray (`bg-gray-500`)
- 🟠 `AWAITING_CONFIRMATION` → Orange (`bg-brand-brightOrange`)

- Checkmark when selected
- Disabled state for non-selectable months

**Selectable Months**:
- ✅ `OVERDUE`, `GRACE_PERIOD`, `PENDING`, `NOT_DUE`
- ❌ `PAID`, `CANCELLED`, `AWAITING_CONFIRMATION`, `NOT_CREATED`

### 4. **Proceed Button**

## 🔧 Technical Details

### State Management
```typescript
const [paymentType, setPaymentType] = useState<PaymentType>('card');
const [loading, setLoading] = useState(false);
const [submitting, setSubmitting] = useState(false);
const [months, setMonths] = useState<PaymentMonth[]>([]);
const [currentMonthStatus, setCurrentMonthStatus] = useState<string>('');
const [selectedMonths, setSelectedMonths] = useState<Set<string>>(new Set());
```

### Child ID Extraction
```typescript
const { activeProfile } = useProfileStore();
const childId = activeProfile?.id ? 
  parseInt(activeProfile.id.replace('child-', '')) : null;
```

### Month Selection Logic
```typescript
const toggleMonthSelection = (year: number, month: number) => {
  const key = `${year}-${month}`;
  const newSelection = new Set(selectedMonths);
  
  if (newSelection.has(key)) {
    newSelection.delete(key);
  } else {
    newSelection.add(key);
  }
  
  setSelectedMonths(newSelection);
};
```

## 🐛 Known Limitations

1. **Card Payment**: Currently shows placeholder - needs payment gateway integration
2. **Price Display**: Uses hardcoded values - should fetch from backend
3. **Profile Type Check**: Assumes child profile - should validate type
4. **Offline Support**: No offline caching - requires internet connection
