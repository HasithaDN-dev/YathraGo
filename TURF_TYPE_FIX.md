# Turf.js Type Error Fix

## Issue
TypeScript compilation was failing with 5 errors related to Turf.js `distance()` function:

```
error TS2345: Argument of type '{ units: string; }' is not assignable to parameter of type 
'"kilometers" | "miles" | "nauticalmiles" | "degrees" | "radians" | "inches" | "yards" | 
"meters" | "metres" | "kilometres" | undefined'.
```

## Root Cause
The Turf.js `distance()` function signature changed between versions. The current version expects the units parameter as a **direct string literal**, not as an options object with a `units` property.

## Solution
Changed all 5 occurrences from object notation to direct string parameter:

### Before (Incorrect):
```typescript
turf.distance(point1, point2, { units: 'kilometers' })
```

### After (Correct):
```typescript
turf.distance(point1, point2, 'kilometers')
```

## Files Modified
- `backend/src/driver-request/driver-request.service.ts` (Lines 674-722)

## Changes Made
1. Line 674-677: Pickup to nearest city initial distance
2. Line 681-682: Pickup to city loop distance calculation
3. Line 693-696: Drop to nearest city initial distance
4. Line 700-701: Drop to city loop distance calculation
5. Line 719-722: Distance between the two nearest cities

## Result
✅ All TypeScript compilation errors resolved  
✅ Backend compiles successfully  
✅ Distance calculations remain functionally identical  
✅ No behavior changes - only type corrections

## Testing
No testing required - this is purely a type correction. The actual distance calculation logic remains unchanged.

---

**Status**: ✅ FIXED - Backend now compiles without errors
