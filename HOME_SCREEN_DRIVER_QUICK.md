# Quick Summary: Home Screen Driver Display

## What Was Done
Implemented automatic display of assigned driver and vehicle on customer app home screen, loading data from `ChildRideRequest` and `StaffRideRequest` tables.

## Key Features
✅ **Automatic Loading** - Fetches on app start and profile change  
✅ **Real-Time Updates** - Refreshes after accepting ride request  
✅ **Smart States** - Loading, assigned, and no-assignment states  
✅ **Profile-Specific** - Shows correct driver for each child/staff  
✅ **Conditional UI** - Action buttons only show when driver assigned  

## New Backend Endpoints
```
GET /customer/assigned-ride/child/:childId
GET /customer/assigned-ride/staff
```

## New Frontend Files
```
mobile-customer/lib/api/assigned-ride.api.ts
mobile-customer/lib/stores/assigned-ride.store.ts
```

## Modified Files
```
backend/src/customer/customer.service.ts
backend/src/customer/customer.controller.ts
mobile-customer/app/(tabs)/index.tsx
mobile-customer/app/(menu)/find-driver/request-detail.tsx
```

## Testing
1. Accept a ride request → Home shows assigned driver
2. Switch profiles → Display updates correctly
3. No assignment → Shows "Find vehicle" message
4. Multiple children → Each shows their own driver

## Next Steps
1. **Restart backend** to apply changes
2. Test with accepted ride requests
3. Verify home screen displays driver info
4. Check profile switching updates correctly
