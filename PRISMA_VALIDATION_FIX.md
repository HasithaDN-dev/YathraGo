# Prisma Validation Error Fixes

## Date: October 16, 2025

## Errors Fixed

### 1. Vehicle Creation Error ✅
**Error:** `Argument manufactureYear is missing`

**Root Cause:** 
The `parseInt()` operation was being done inline, which could potentially fail or not be properly recognized by Prisma.

**Solution:**
```typescript
// Before (error)
manufactureYear: parseInt(registrationData.yearOfManufacture),

// After (fixed)
const manufactureYear = parseInt(registrationData.yearOfManufacture);

// Validate that manufactureYear is a valid number
if (isNaN(manufactureYear)) {
  throw new BadRequestException('Invalid year of manufacture');
}

// Then use it
manufactureYear: manufactureYear,
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Explicit variable ensures Prisma recognizes the value
- ✅ Added validation to catch invalid year formats
- ✅ Better error messages for debugging

### 2. Driver Profile Error
**Error:** `Argument driver_id is missing in getDriverProfile`

**Status:** ✅ Code already correct
The `getDriverProfile` method already has the correct implementation:
```typescript
async getDriverProfile(driverId: string) {
  const driver = await this.prisma.driver.findUnique({
    where: { driver_id: parseInt(driverId) },
  });
  // ...
}
```

This error appears to be caused by the first error preventing proper execution flow.

## Testing

After these fixes:
1. Complete driver registration flow should work
2. Vehicle record should be created successfully
3. Both driver and vehicle should be saved to database

## Files Modified
- `backend/src/driver/driver.service.ts` - Fixed manufactureYear parsing and validation

## Expected Result
```
✅ Driver registration completed
✅ Driver record created with registrationStatus = ACCOUNT_CREATED
✅ Vehicle record created and linked to driver
✅ All files uploaded successfully
```
