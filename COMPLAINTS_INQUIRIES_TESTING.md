## API Testing with Postman

### 1. Create Complaint
```
POST http://localhost:3000/complaints-inquiries
Headers:
  Content-Type: application/json
  Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN

Body:
{
  "senderId": 1,
  "senderUserType": "CHILD",
  "type": "COMPLAINT",
  "description": "Test complaint from Postman",
  "category": "SYSTEM"
}
```

### 2. Get Complaints
```
GET http://localhost:3000/complaints-inquiries/sender/1?senderUserType=CHILD
Headers:
  Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN
```

## Database Verification

### Check Created Records:
```sql
SELECT * FROM "ComplaintsInquiries" 
ORDER BY status, "createdAt" DESC;
```

### Check by Sender:
```sql
SELECT * FROM "ComplaintsInquiries" 
WHERE "senderId" = 1 
  AND "senderUserType" = 'CHILD'
ORDER BY status, "createdAt" DESC;
```

### Update Status (for testing):
```sql
UPDATE "ComplaintsInquiries"
SET status = 'IN_PROGRESS'
WHERE id = 1;

UPDATE "ComplaintsInquiries"
SET status = 'RESOLVED'
WHERE id = 2;
```

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "No active profile or authentication token"
**Solution:** Ensure user is logged in and has selected a profile

### Issue: Backend returns 401 Unauthorized
**Solution:** Check accessToken is valid and not expired

### Issue: Wrong complaints showing
**Solution:** Verify `senderId` and `senderUserType` match active profile

### Issue: Status badge not colored
**Solution:** Check status value is exactly: PENDING, IN_PROGRESS, or RESOLVED

### Issue: Data not refreshing
**Solution:** Check `useFocusEffect` is working, or navigate away and back

1. Create 50+ complaints for one profile
