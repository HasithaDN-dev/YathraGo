## 🐛 **TROUBLESHOOTING**

### **Problem: "Driver ID not found"**
**Solution:**
- Make sure you're logged in as a driver
- Check auth store has user data
- Re-login if needed

---

### **Problem: "Failed to fetch trip history"**
**Solution:**
- Check backend server is running
- Verify API URL in `.env` file
- Check network connection
- Look at backend console for errors

---

### **Problem: "No trips found" but data exists**
**Solution:**
- Verify driver ID in database matches logged-in driver
- Check `Child_Trip` table has `driverId` set correctly
- Run SQL query to confirm:
  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM "Child_Trip" WHERE "driverId" = 1;
  ```

---

### **Problem: App shows old data**
**Solution:**
- Pull down to refresh
- Or restart the app
- Check backend is returning latest data

---

## 📊 **EXPECTED BEHAVIOR**

### **When Opening History Screen:**

```
1. Shows loading spinner (1-2 seconds)
   ↓
2. Fetches data from backend
   ↓
3. Groups trips by date
   ↓
4. Displays trips with date headers

──── Yesterday ────  ← Passes this section
[Header shows: Yesterday]  ← Header updates!
[Trip 3]
[Trip 4]
```

## 🎯 **DEMO SCENARIO**

For a full demonstration:

1. **Add test trips to database:**
   ```sql
   INSERT INTO "Child_Trip" 
     ("pickUp", "dropOff", "startTime", "endTime", "driverId")
   VALUES 
     ('123 Main St, Colombo', 'ABC School', '2024-10-16 08:00:00', '2024-10-16 08:30:00', 1),
     ('456 Park Ave, Colombo', 'XYZ College', '2024-10-16 14:00:00', '2024-10-16 14:45:00', 1),
     ('789 Lake Rd, Kandy', 'Central School', '2024-10-15 07:00:00', '2024-10-15 07:40:00', 1);
   ```

2. **Login as driver ID 1**

3. **Go to History tab**

4. **You should see:**
   - Today section with 2 trips
   - Yesterday section with 1 trip
   - Header showing "Today" initially
   - Header changing to "Yesterday" when scrolling
