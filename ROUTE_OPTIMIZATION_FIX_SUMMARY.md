# Route Optimization Fix Summary

## 🎯 Problem Fixed

The route optimization system was showing students in the wrong order (database order instead of geographical order), and was not filtering out absent students.

---

## ✅ What Was Fixed

### **Issue 1: Absent Students Not Filtered**

**Problem**: The `optimize-route` endpoint was returning ALL assigned students, including those marked as absent for today.

**Fix**:

- Added filtering logic to exclude students in the `Absence_Child` table for today's date
- Only present students are now included in route optimization

```typescript
// Backend: driver.controller.ts (Lines 235-259)

// Filter out absent students for today
const today = new Date();
today.setHours(0, 0, 0, 0);
const tomorrow = new Date(today);
tomorrow.setDate(tomorrow.getDate() + 1);

const absentToday = await this.prisma.absence_Child.findMany({
  where: {
    childId: { in: assignedRequests.map((r) => r.childId) },
    date: {
      gte: today,
      lt: tomorrow,
    },
  },
});

const absentChildIds = new Set(absentToday.map((a) => a.childId));
const requests = assignedRequests.filter((r) => !absentChildIds.has(r.childId));
```

---

### **Issue 2: Students Ordered by Database ID, Not Geography**

**Problem**: Students were appearing in database order (based on `ChildRideRequest.id`) rather than geographical proximity to the driver's current location.

**Fix**:

- Made driver's GPS location **required** for route optimization
- Properly configured Google Maps Distance Matrix API to start from driver's location
- Fixed the greedy algorithm to start from index 0 (driver's location)

```typescript
// Backend: driver.controller.ts

// Require driver location
if (!origin) {
  return {
    degraded: true,
    message: 'Driver location required for route optimization',
    ...
  };
}

// Build matrix with driver location as first origin
const dmOrigins: string[] = [makeLoc(origin)]; // Driver's location FIRST
points.forEach((p) => dmOrigins.push(makeLoc(p))); // Then all stops

// Use greedy algorithm starting from driver's location (index 0)
const ordered = computeGreedyOrder(stops, matrix, capacity, 0);
```

---

### **Issue 3: Matrix Indexing Errors**

**Problem**: The distance matrix row indexing was incorrect when calculating leg distances and durations.

**Fix**:

- Start from driver's location (index 0 in matrix)
- Properly increment matrix row index after each stop
- Correct calculation: `prevIndexForMatrix = 1 + destIdx` (add 1 because driver location is at index 0)

```typescript
// Backend: driver.controller.ts (Lines 401-424)

// Start from driver's location (index 0 in matrix)
let prevIndexForMatrix = 0;

for (let i = 0; i < ordered.length; i++) {
  const s = ordered[i];

  const destIdx = stops.indexOf(s);
  legDuration = matrix.durations[prevIndexForMatrix]?.[destIdx] ?? 0;
  legDistance = matrix.distances[prevIndexForMatrix]?.[destIdx] ?? 0;

  // Next origin is this stop (add 1 because driver location is at index 0)
  prevIndexForMatrix = 1 + destIdx;

  totalDurationSecs += legDuration;
  totalDistanceMeters += legDistance;

  stopsOut.push({
    ...s,
    etaSecs: now + totalDurationSecs,
    legDistanceMeters: legDistance,
  });
}
```

### **Issue 4: Better Error Handling**

**Problem**: Failed API calls would proceed with empty data.

**Fix**:

- Check Google Maps API response status
- Return error if distance matrix fails (cannot proceed with geographical optimization)
- Better logging for debugging

```typescript
// Backend: driver.controller.ts (Lines 347-375)

if (res.data?.status === 'OK') {
  // Process matrix data
  matrix = { durations, distances };
} else {
  console.error('Google Maps API error:', res.data?.status);
  degraded = true;
}

// If matrix failed, cannot proceed
if (!matrix) {
  return {
    degraded: true,
    message: 'Failed to fetch distance matrix from Google Maps',
    stops: [],
    ...
  };
}
```

## 📊 Corrected Flow

### **Step 1: Get Assigned Students**

```
GET all ChildRideRequest where driverId = X and status = 'Assigned'
```

### **Step 2: Filter Absent Students**

```
GET all Absence_Child where date = TODAY
Filter out absent childIds from assigned list
→ Result: Only PRESENT students
```

### **Step 3: Build Stops Array**

```
For each present student:
  - Add pickup location (from Child.pickupLatitude/Longitude)
  - Add dropoff location (from Child.schoolLatitude/Longitude)
→ Result: Array of all pickup and dropoff locations
```

### **Step 4: Get Driver Location**

```
Require driver's GPS coordinates (latitude, longitude)
If not provided → Return error (cannot optimize without location)
```

### **Step 5: Build Distance Matrix**

```
Origins: [DriverLocation, Stop1, Stop2, Stop3, ...]
Destinations: [Stop1, Stop2, Stop3, ...]

Call Google Maps Distance Matrix API
→ Get travel times and distances between all points
```

### **Step 6: Geographical Optimization**

```
Use greedy algorithm with constraints:
- Start from driver's current location (index 0)
- Pickup must come before dropoff for each child
- Respect vehicle capacity (if set)
- Always choose closest eligible next stop

→ Result: Geographically optimized order
```

### **Step 7: Calculate ETAs**

```
For each stop in optimized order:
  - Calculate leg distance and duration
  - Calculate cumulative travel time
  - Calculate ETA (current time + cumulative time)

→ Result: Ordered stops with accurate ETAs
```

### **Step 8: Generate Map Polyline**

```
Call Google Directions API with:
- Origin: Driver location
- Waypoints: All stops except last
- Destination: Last stop

→ Result: Route polyline for map display
```

## 🔍 Example Scenario

### **Given:**

- Driver at: `(6.900, 79.900)`
- Child ID 5 pickup at: `(6.850, 79.880)` - **1.5km from driver**
- Child ID 7 pickup at: `(6.950, 79.920)` - **6.2km from driver**
- Child ID 5 school at: `(6.920, 79.910)`
- Child ID 7 school at: `(6.940, 79.930)`

### **Before Fix (Wrong):**

```
Order based on database ID:
1. Child ID 5 (might be listed second in DB)
2. Child ID 7 (might be listed first in DB)
```

### **After Fix (Correct):**

```
Order based on geography from driver location:
1. Pickup Child ID 5 (6.850, 79.880) - Closest to driver
2. Pickup Child ID 7 (6.950, 79.920) - Next closest
3. Dropoff Child ID 5 (6.920, 79.910) - On the way
4. Dropoff Child ID 7 (6.940, 79.930) - Final destination
```

## 📱 Frontend Impact

### **Home Screen**

- **Student count**: Now shows only present students
- Absent students automatically excluded

### **Current Students Tab**

- **Already filtered correctly** (uses `child-ride-requests` endpoint which was already filtering absent students)

### **Navigation Screen**

- **Route order**: Now geographically optimized
- **Stops appear**: In correct order based on driver's location
- **First stop**: Will be the closest pickup to driver
- **ETA calculations**: Now accurate based on actual route

## 🧪 Testing

### **Test Case 1: Absent Student Filtering**

1. Mark a student as absent for today in the database:

```sql
INSERT INTO "Absence_Child" (reason, "childId", date)
VALUES ('Sick', 5, CURRENT_DATE);
```

2. Call optimize-route endpoint

3. **Expected**: Child ID 5 should NOT appear in the stops array

---

### **Test Case 2: Geographical Ordering**

1. Set driver location in mobile app (or manually in API call):

```json
{
  "latitude": 6.9,
  "longitude": 79.9
}
```

2. Check the order of stops returned

3. **Expected**:
   - First stop should be the geographically closest pickup
   - Not based on database ID order

---

### **Test Case 3: Without Driver Location**

1. Call optimize-route WITHOUT providing latitude/longitude

2. **Expected Response**:

```json
{
  "degraded": true,
  "message": "Driver location required for route optimization",
  "stops": []
}
```
