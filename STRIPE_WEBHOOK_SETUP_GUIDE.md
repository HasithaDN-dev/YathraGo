# Stripe Webhook Setup Guide - Complete Real-World Integration

## ðŸŽ¯ Goal
Set up Stripe webhooks so payments are automatically marked as PAID without driver confirmation.

## ðŸ“‹ Prerequisites
- Stripe account (you already have test keys)
- Backend running on a public URL or using ngrok for local testing

---

## Option 1: Local Testing with ngrok (Recommended for Development)

### Step 1: Install ngrok
Download from: https://ngrok.com/download

### Step 2: Start your backend
```bash
cd backend
npm run start:dev
```
Backend should be running on `http://localhost:3000`

### Step 3: Start ngrok tunnel
```bash
ngrok http 3000
```

You'll see output like:
```
Forwarding    https://abcd-1234-5678.ngrok-free.app -> http://localhost:3000
```

**Copy the HTTPS URL** (e.g., `https://abcd-1234-5678.ngrok-free.app`)

### Step 4: Configure Stripe Webhook

1. **Go to Stripe Dashboard**: https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/webhooks

2. **Click "Add endpoint"**

3. **Enter Endpoint URL**:
   ```
   https://YOUR-NGROK-URL.ngrok-free.app/stripe/webhook
   ```
   Example: `https://abcd-1234-5678.ngrok-free.app/stripe/webhook`

4. **Select Events to Listen To**:
   - Click "Select events"
   - Check these events:
     - âœ… `payment_intent.succeeded`
     - âœ… `payment_intent.payment_failed`
     - âœ… `payment_intent.canceled`

5. **Click "Add endpoint"**

6. **Copy the Webhook Signing Secret**:
   - After creating, click on the webhook
   - Find "Signing secret" (starts with `whsec_...`)
   - Click "Reveal" and copy it

7. **Update your `.env` file**:
   ```properties
   STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET="whsec_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
   ```

8. **Restart backend**:
   ```bash
   # Stop backend (Ctrl+C)
   npm run start:dev
   ```

## Option 2: Production/Deployed Backend

If your backend is deployed (e.g., on Heroku, AWS, etc.):

1. **Go to**: https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/webhooks
2. **Click "Add endpoint"**
3. **Enter URL**: `https://your-production-domain.com/stripe/webhook`
4. **Select events**: `payment_intent.succeeded`, `payment_intent.payment_failed`, `payment_intent.canceled`
5. **Copy webhook secret** and add to `.env`

---

## Testing the Webhook

### Step 1: Make a test payment
1. Open mobile app
2. Select a month
3. Pay with test card: `4242 4242 4242 4242`

### Step 2: Check Stripe Dashboard
1. Go to: https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/webhooks
2. Click on your webhook endpoint
3. You should see webhook events being sent
4. Check if they show "Success" (green checkmark)

### Step 3: Check Backend Logs
You should see:
```
[Nest] LOG [StripeService] Webhook received: payment_intent.succeeded
[Nest] LOG [StripeService] Payment succeeded: pi_xxxxx
[Nest] LOG [StripeService] Updated 2 payment records to PAID
```

### Step 4: Check Database
Payment records should have:
- `paymentStatus`: `PAID`
- `amountPaid`: amount paid
- `paymentDate`: current date

---

## Troubleshooting

### Webhook shows "Timeout" or "Failed"
- **Check**: Is backend running?
- **Check**: Is ngrok tunnel active?
- **Solution**: Restart backend and ngrok

### Backend shows "Webhook signature verification failed"
- **Check**: Is `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` correct?
- **Solution**: Copy secret again from Stripe dashboard

### Payment succeeds but not marked as PAID
- **Check**: Backend logs for webhook events
- **Check**: Stripe dashboard webhook events
- **Solution**: Webhook might not be configured correctly

## Production Deployment Checklist

When moving to production:

1. âœ… Change Stripe keys from test to live:
   ```properties
   STRIPE_SECRET_KEY="sk_live_xxxxx"  # Live secret key
   STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY="pk_live_xxxxx"  # Live publishable key
   ```

2. âœ… Update webhook endpoint to production URL

3. âœ… Get live webhook secret from production webhook

4. âœ… Test with real card (small amount first!)

5. âœ… Monitor Stripe dashboard for live events

---

## Security Notes

- âœ… Webhook secret validates requests are from Stripe
- âœ… Never expose webhook secret publicly
- âœ… Backend verifies signature before processing
- âœ… Failed verifications are logged and rejected

---

*Setup completed! Your Stripe integration will now automatically mark payments as PAID.*
