  title: string;
  value: string;
  change?: string;
  changeType?: 'positive' | 'negative' | 'neutral';
  icon: React.ElementType;
  colorClass: string;
}

interface PaymentStatusData {

## 🔄 Next Steps for Backend Integration

To connect this page to real data, you'll need to create API endpoints:

### 1. Statistics Summary Endpoint
```
GET /api/finance/statistics?timeRange=month
```
Should return:
- Daily/Weekly/Monthly/Yearly revenue
- Payment status counts and amounts
- Collection rates
- Overdue information

### 2. Payment Status Distribution
```
GET /api/finance/payment-status-distribution
```
Should query `ChildPayment` model grouped by `paymentStatus`

### 3. Top Customers Endpoint
```
GET /api/finance/top-customers?limit=5
```
Should aggregate `ChildPayment` by `customerId`

### 4. Recent Payments Endpoint
```
GET /api/finance/recent-payments?limit=5
```
Should fetch latest `ChildPayment` records with customer/child details

### 5. Risk Indicators Endpoint
```
GET /api/finance/risk-indicators
```
Should analyze:
- Customers with multiple overdue payments
- High `carryForwardDue` amounts
- Grace period payments near expiry

## 🗄️ Database Queries Needed

### Based on Prisma Schema Models:

#### ChildPayment Queries
```prisma
// Today's revenue
ChildPayment.aggregate({
  where: { 
    paymentStatus: 'PAID',
    updatedAt: { gte: startOfToday }
  },
  _sum: { amountPaid: true }
})

// Payment status distribution
ChildPayment.groupBy({
  by: ['paymentStatus'],
  _count: true,
  _sum: { finalPrice: true }
})

// Overdue payments
ChildPayment.findMany({
  where: { paymentStatus: 'OVERDUE' },
  include: { Customer: true, Child: true }
})
```

#### MonthlyPayment Queries
```prisma
// Monthly payment summary
MonthlyPayment.aggregate({
  where: { 
    month: currentMonth,
    paid: true 
  },
  _sum: { amount: true }
})
```

#### PaymentBalance Queries
```prisma
// Total outstanding balance
PaymentBalance.aggregate({
  _sum: { balance: true, amountDue: true }
})
```

## 🎯 Recommended Enhancements

1. **Charts Integration**: Add Chart.js or Recharts for visual graphs
2. **Export Functionality**: PDF/Excel export for reports
3. **Date Range Picker**: Custom date range selection
4. **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket for live payment notifications
5. **Filters**: By driver, customer, payment method, status
6. **Drill-down**: Click metrics to see detailed breakdowns

## 📱 Responsive Behavior

- **Desktop**: Full grid layout with all panels visible
- **Tablet**: 2-column grid for metrics
- **Mobile**: Single column stacked layout

## 🔐 Access Control

- Page is protected by Finance Manager role in layout
- Only users with `Role.FINANCE_MANAGER` can access
