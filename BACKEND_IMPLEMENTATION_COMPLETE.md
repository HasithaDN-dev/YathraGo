## 🔐 Security Considerations

### **Role-Based Access** (To be added)
```typescript
// Example usage (implement with guards)
@Post('payouts/approve')
@Roles('FINANCE_MANAGER')
async approvePayout() {}

@Post('refunds/:id/approve')
@Roles('FINANCE_MANAGER')
async approveRefund() {}

@Post('complaints')
@Roles('CUSTOMER', 'DRIVER', 'OWNER')
async createComplaint() {}
```

### **Audit Logging** (Model ready)
- All financial operations should log to `AuditLog`
- Track who approved/rejected refunds
- Track payment verifications
- Track status changes
