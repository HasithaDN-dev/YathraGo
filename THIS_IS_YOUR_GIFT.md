## Quick Start (3 Simple Steps!)

### 1️⃣ Install ngrok
Download: https://ngrok.com/download

### 2️⃣ Run These Commands
```bash
# Terminal 1: Start backend
cd backend
npm run start:dev

# Terminal 2: Start ngrok
ngrok http 3000
# Copy the https URL (e.g., https://abcd-1234.ngrok-free.app)

# Terminal 3: Start mobile app
cd mobile-customer
npx expo start --clear
```

### 3️⃣ Configure Stripe Webhook
1. Go to: https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/webhooks
2. Click "Add endpoint"
3. URL: `https://YOUR-NGROK-URL.ngrok-free.app/stripe/webhook`
4. Events: `payment_intent.succeeded`, `payment_intent.payment_failed`
5. Copy webhook secret (starts with `whsec_...`)
6. Add to `backend/.env`:
   ```
   STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET="whsec_xxxxx"
   ```
7. Restart backend

## Test Payment

1. Open mobile app
2. Select a month
3. Tap "Pay Rs. X,XXX.00"
4. **Stripe Payment Sheet appears** ✨

## What Makes This Special

### 🚀 **Production Ready**
- Secure (Stripe's industry-leading security)
- Reliable (redundant confirmation methods)
- Automatic (no manual intervention needed)
- Scalable (handles any volume)
- Well-documented (complete guides provided)

### 💎 **Professional Features**
- Multiple months payment
- Automatic status updates
- Clear error messages
- Transaction tracking
- Real-time updates

   - Use your production URL instead of ngrok
