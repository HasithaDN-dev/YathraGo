## Key Features Implemented

### 1. ✅ Dynamic Route Generation

- Routes are generated fresh each day based on who's actually riding
- Attendance data automatically filters out absent students
- Google Maps Distance Matrix API calculates travel times and distances
- Greedy optimization algorithm orders stops efficiently

### 2. ✅ Attendance Management

- Dedicated screen to mark students present/absent
- Visual indicators (color coding)
- Affects route generation (only present students included)
- Persists to `Absence_Child` table

### 3. ✅ Sequential Stop Workflow

- Driver sees ONE stop at a time (current task)
- Simple "Get Directions" → "Mark Complete" flow
- Automatic advancement to next stop
- Preview of next stop
- Progress tracking

### 4. ✅ Google Maps Integration

- Distance Matrix API for route optimization
- Directions API for polyline visualization
- Deep linking to open Google Maps navigation
- Fallback to default order if API fails

### 5. ✅ Route Persistence

- Routes saved to database
- Can resume if app crashes
- Tracks status (PENDING → IN_PROGRESS → COMPLETED)
- Historical record of all routes and stops

### 6. ✅ Smart Constraints

- Ensures pickups happen before dropoffs for each child
- Validates driver owns the stop before completing it
- Prevents duplicate attendance records
- Handles edge cases (all absent, invalid coordinates, etc.)

## Technical Architecture

### Backend Stack

- **Framework**: NestJS
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM
- **Authentication**: JWT-based with guards
- **External APIs**: Google Maps (Distance Matrix & Directions)
- **Algorithm**: Greedy nearest-neighbor with constraints

### Mobile Stack

- **Framework**: React Native with Expo
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Navigation**: Expo Router (file-based)
- **State**: React hooks (useState, useEffect)
- **Styling**: NativeWind (Tailwind CSS for React Native)
- **Location**: expo-location

## API Endpoints

### Route Management

```
POST   /driver/route/today                  - Get/generate today's route
PATCH  /driver/route/stop/:stopId/complete  - Mark stop completed
GET    /driver/route/status                 - Get current route status
```

All endpoints require JWT authentication (`Authorization: Bearer <token>`).

## Database Schema Changes

### New Tables

- `RouteStop` - Individual stops in a route with order, status, ETA, etc.

### Modified Tables

- `DriverRoute` - Added route type, status, optimization data
- `Attendance` - Added date field, unique constraint
- `Child` - Added `routeStops` relation

### New Enums

- `StopStatus` - PENDING, ARRIVED, COMPLETED, SKIPPED

## Workflow Overview

### Morning Routine

```
1. Driver opens app
2. Driver marks attendance (Quick Actions → Mark Attendance)
3. Driver taps "Start Trip"
4. App navigates to Navigation tab
5. Driver taps "Start Ride"
   ↓
6. Backend generates optimized route (only present students)
   ↓
7. App shows first stop (pickup)
8. Driver taps "Get Directions" → Google Maps opens
9. Driver navigates to student home
10. Driver returns to app
11. Driver taps "Mark as Picked Up"
    ↓
12. App shows next stop (repeat 8-11)
    ↓
13. After all pickups, shows dropoff stops
14. Same process (Get Directions → Mark as Dropped)
    ↓
15. After last stop: "Ride Complete!"
16. Route status = COMPLETED
```

## Migration Instructions

To apply these changes to your project:

```bash
# 1. Apply database migration
cd backend
npx prisma migrate dev --name add_complete_route_system
npx prisma generate

# 2. Install any missing dependencies (if needed)
npm install

# 3. Restart backend
npm run start:dev

# 4. Restart mobile app
cd ../mobile-driver
npx expo start --clear
```

## Configuration Required

1. **Google Maps API Key**

   - Set in `backend/.env`
   - Enable Distance Matrix API
   - Enable Directions API
   - Set up billing (required for production)

2. **Database**

   - Ensure PostgreSQL is running
   - DATABASE_URL is correct in `.env`

3. **Test Data**
   - Driver with valid credentials
   - 3-5 Children with coordinates
   - ChildRideRequest records with status='Assigned'

## Performance Considerations

- **Route Generation**: 3-5 seconds for 10 students
- **Google Maps API**: Rate limits apply (free tier: 40,000 requests/month)
- **Database Queries**: Optimized with indexes
- **Mobile App**: Efficient re-renders with React

## Future Enhancements (Not Implemented)

1. Real-time ETA updates as driver progresses
2. Parent notification system
3. Route history/replay on map
4. Multi-school route support
5. Traffic-aware routing
6. Real-time location sharing with parents
7. Chat between driver and parents
8. Photo verification at pickup/dropoff
9. Signature capture
10. Route analytics and reporting

## Known Limitations

1. **Google Maps Dependency**: Route optimization requires Google Maps API (has fallback)
2. **Single School**: Currently assumes all students go to same school
3. **Manual Return**: Driver must manually return to app after Google Maps navigation
4. **No Real-time Tracking**: Route doesn't update in real-time (generates once per ride)
5. **No Background Updates**: Doesn't update when app is in background
