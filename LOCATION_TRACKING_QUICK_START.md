# Driver Location Tracking - Quick Start Guide

## What Was Implemented?

Real-time driver location tracking that allows customers to see their assigned driver's live location on a map when the driver starts their ride.

## How It Works

### For Drivers
1. Go to **Navigation** tab
2. Tap **"Start Ride"** button
3. Your location is now being shared with assigned customers (green "Sharing location" indicator appears)
4. Complete your stops as normal
5. When you finish the last stop, location sharing automatically stops

### For Customers
1. Go to **Navigate** tab
2. If you have an assigned driver, you'll automatically see:
   - Driver's location as a green car marker on the map
   - A dashed line connecting you to the driver
   - Driver info card at the bottom showing "Driver on the way"
   - Live indicator (green dot) when tracking is active
3. The map auto-centers to show both you and your driver
4. Driver marker updates every 10 seconds

## Testing Steps

### Quick Test (5 minutes)

1. **Start Backend**:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm run start:dev
   ```

2. **Start Driver App**:
   ```bash
   cd mobile-driver
   npm start
   ```
   - Login as driver
   - Go to Navigation tab
   - Tap "Start Ride"
   - ✅ See "Sharing location" indicator

3. **Start Customer App**:
   ```bash
   cd mobile-customer
   npm start
   ```
   - Login as customer with assigned child
   - Go to Navigate tab
   - ✅ See green car marker moving on map
   - ✅ See "Driver on the way" card

4. **Complete Ride**:
   - In driver app, complete all stops
   - ✅ Customer sees "Ride Completed" alert
   - ✅ Driver marker disappears

## Key Features

✨ **Real-time Updates**: Location updates every 10 seconds  
🔄 **Auto-reconnect**: Handles connection drops gracefully  
🗺️ **Smart Zoom**: Map auto-centers to show both user and driver  
🎯 **Gatekeeper**: Only broadcasts when ride is active  
🔋 **Battery Optimized**: Uses balanced GPS accuracy  
👥 **Multi-customer**: Multiple customers can track same driver  

## Technology Stack

- **WebSocket**: Socket.IO for real-time communication
- **GPS**: expo-location for device positioning
- **Maps**: react-native-maps with Google Maps
- **Backend**: NestJS with WebSocket Gateway

## Configuration

### Update Location Frequency
`mobile-driver/lib/services/driver-location.service.ts`:
```typescript
const LOCATION_UPDATE_INTERVAL = 10000; // Change to 5000 for faster updates
const MIN_DISTANCE_CHANGE = 10; // Change to 5 for more frequent updates
```

### Change Map Style
`mobile-customer/app/(tabs)/navigate.tsx`:
```typescript
<MapView
  mapType="hybrid" // or "satellite" or "terrain"
  ...
/>
```

## Troubleshooting

### ❌ Customer not seeing driver
**Check**:
1. Is driver's "Start Ride" pressed? (Look for green indicator)
2. Is customer assigned to this driver?
3. Are both apps connected to same backend URL?

**Solution**: Check console logs for WebSocket connection status

### ❌ Location not updating
**Check**:
1. Does driver app have location permissions?
2. Is GPS enabled on driver's device?

**Solution**: Go to Settings → Apps → Driver App → Permissions → Location → Allow all the time

### ❌ "Socket connection error"
**Check**:
1. Is backend server running?
2. Is API_URL correct in `.env` files?

**Solution**: 
```bash
# mobile-driver/.env
EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://YOUR_LOCAL_IP:3000

# mobile-customer/.env  
EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://YOUR_LOCAL_IP:3000
```

## Console Output Examples

### ✅ Successful Driver Start
```
✅ Connected to location tracking server
📍 Location tracking started
📍 Location updated: 6.927100, 79.861200
```

### ✅ Successful Customer Tracking
```
✅ Connected to location tracking server
📡 Subscribing to route 123...
✅ Subscribed to route 123
📍 Driver location received: { latitude: 6.927100, longitude: 79.861200 }
```

## Next Steps

1. ✅ **Test the feature** following the steps above
2. 📱 **Test on real devices** for accurate GPS data
3. 🚗 **Drive around** to see live tracking in action
4. 🎨 **Customize UI** colors and styles to match your brand
5. 📊 **Monitor logs** for any connection issues

## Support

For detailed documentation, see: `DRIVER_LOCATION_TRACKING_GUIDE.md`

For issues:
1. Check console logs in both apps
2. Verify WebSocket connection status
3. Review backend logs for errors
