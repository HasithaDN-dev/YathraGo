## 🐛 Known Issues

### **Minor Issues (Non-blocking):**
1. ⚠️ ESLint warnings about `any` types in driver-request.service.ts
   - **Impact:** None, just code quality warnings
   - **Fix:** Can be addressed later with proper typing

2. ⚠️ Line ending warnings (CRLF vs LF)
   - **Impact:** None, cosmetic only
   - **Fix:** Run Prettier or configure Git

### **No Critical Issues** ✅

---

## 🔒 Security Considerations

### **To Add (Important):**
```typescript
// 1. Authentication Guards
@UseGuards(JwtAuthGuard)
@Controller('payments')

// 2. Role-Based Access
@Roles('FINANCE_MANAGER')
@Post('payouts/approve')

// 3. Rate Limiting
@Throttle(10, 60) // 10 requests per minute

// 4. Input Sanitization
// Already using class-validator DTOs ✅

// 5. Audit Logging
// Model ready, needs implementation
```
