# VRP Optimizer Service - Driver Type Support Update

## Issue Fixed
The VRP optimizer service was still only fetching children from `ChildRideRequest`, causing the error:
```
Error: No present students assigned to this driver
```

This happened even for Work type drivers who have staff assigned.

## Changes Made to `vrp-optimizer.service.ts`

### 1. Updated `optimizeMorningRoute` Method (Line 63)
**Added driver type detection:**
```typescript
// Get driver's ride type
const driverCity = await this.prisma.driverCities.findFirst({
  where: { driverId },
  select: { rideType: true },
});
const driverRideType = driverCity?.rideType || 'School';

// Pass driver type to getPresentAssignedChildren
const presentChildren = await this.getPresentAssignedChildren(driverId, driverRideType);

// Dynamic error message
if (presentChildren.length === 0) {
  const passengerType = driverRideType === 'Work' ? 'staff members' : 'students';
  throw new Error(`No present ${passengerType} assigned to this driver`);
}
```

### 2. Updated `optimizeEveningRoute` Method (Line 124)
Same changes as morning route - added driver type detection and passed to `getPresentAssignedChildren`.

### 3. Updated `getPresentAssignedChildren` Method (Line 180)
**Added `rideType` parameter and conditional fetching:**

```typescript
private async getPresentAssignedChildren(
  driverId: number,
  rideType: string = 'School',
): Promise<PresentChild[]> {
  // For Work type drivers, fetch from StaffRideRequest
  if (rideType === 'Work') {
    const staffRequests = await this.prisma.staffRideRequest.findMany({
      where: { driverId, status: 'Assigned' },
      include: {
        staffPassenger: {
          select: {
            id: true,
            pickupLatitude: true,
            pickupLongitude: true,
            pickupAddress: true,
            workLatitude: true,
            workLongitude: true,
            workAddress: true,
            customer: {
              select: { firstName: true, lastName: true },
            },
          },
        },
      },
    });

    // Map staff to PresentChild interface (using childId for compatibility)
    return staffRequests
      .filter((req) => 
        req.staffPassenger.pickupLatitude != null && 
        req.staffPassenger.pickupLongitude != null &&
        req.staffPassenger.workLatitude != null && 
        req.staffPassenger.workLongitude != null
      )
      .map((req) => ({
        childId: req.staffPassenger.id,
        childName: `${req.staffPassenger.customer.firstName} ${req.staffPassenger.customer.lastName}`,
        pickupLatitude: req.staffPassenger.pickupLatitude!,
        pickupLongitude: req.staffPassenger.pickupLongitude!,
        pickupAddress: req.staffPassenger.pickupAddress,
        schoolLatitude: req.staffPassenger.workLatitude!,
        schoolLongitude: req.staffPassenger.workLongitude!,
        schoolAddress: req.staffPassenger.workAddress,
      }));
  }

  // For School type drivers, fetch from ChildRideRequest (existing logic)
  // ... existing code for children ...
}
```

### 4. Updated `createFallbackResult` Method (Line 757)
**Added driver type detection for fallback routes:**

```typescript
private async createFallbackResult(driverId: number, routeType: 'morning' | 'evening'): Promise<VRPResult> {
  // Get driver's ride type
  const driverCity = await this.prisma.driverCities.findFirst({
    where: { driverId },
    select: { rideType: true },
  });
  const driverRideType = driverCity?.rideType || 'School';

  // Pass driver type to get correct passengers
  const presentChildren = await this.getPresentAssignedChildren(driverId, driverRideType);
  
  // ... rest of fallback logic ...
}
```

## How It Works

### For Work Type Drivers:
1. VRP optimizer calls `optimizeMorningRoute(driverId)`
2. Gets `rideType = 'Work'` from `DriverCities`
3. Calls `getPresentAssignedChildren(driverId, 'Work')`
4. Fetches from `StaffRideRequest` â†’ `Staff_Passenger` â†’ `Customer`
5. Maps staff data to `PresentChild` interface:
   - `childId` â†’ `staffPassenger.id`
   - `schoolLatitude/Longitude` â†’ `workLatitude/Longitude`
   - `schoolAddress` â†’ `workAddress`
6. Same VRP optimization algorithm runs
7. Returns optimized route with staff stops

### For School Type Drivers:
1. Gets `rideType = 'School'` from `DriverCities`
2. Calls `getPresentAssignedChildren(driverId, 'School')`
3. Fetches from `ChildRideRequest` â†’ `Child`
4. Filters out absent children
5. Returns children data as before

## Key Design Decision

**Reused `PresentChild` Interface:**
- No need to create separate staff interface
- Maps staff work locations to school fields
- Maintains compatibility with existing routing logic
- VRP algorithm doesn't need to know passenger type

## Result

âœ… Work drivers can now start routes without "No present students assigned" error  
âœ… Staff are correctly fetched and optimized by VRP  
âœ… School drivers continue working as before  
âœ… Same routing algorithm for both types  

## Testing

Run as Work type driver:
1. Press "Start Morning Route"
2. **Before**: Error "No present students assigned"
3. **After**: Route created with staff stops

Check logs:
```
[VRPOptimizerService] Starting morning route optimization for driver 12
[VRPOptimizerService] Built 6 morning nodes: pickup(5), dropoff(5), pickup(6), dropoff(6)...
[VRPOptimizerService] Morning route optimization completed for 3 staff members
```

## Files Modified

- `backend/src/driver-route/vrp-optimizer.service.ts`
  - `optimizeMorningRoute()` - Added driver type detection
  - `optimizeEveningRoute()` - Added driver type detection
  - `getPresentAssignedChildren()` - Added rideType parameter, staff fetching logic
  - `createFallbackResult()` - Added driver type detection

## Complete Implementation

Both services now respect driver type:
- âœ… `driver-route.service.ts` - Main route service
- âœ… `vrp-optimizer.service.ts` - VRP optimization service

**Status**: ðŸŽ‰ Complete! Work drivers can now create and optimize routes with staff passengers.
