# Ride Request Negotiation Feature - Implementation Status

## Summary
A comprehensive ride request system has been designed to allow customers to send ride requests to drivers with price negotiation capabilities. The system calculates estimated distance and price, then allows both parties to negotiate until an agreement is reached.

## ✅ Completed Tasks

### 1. Database Schema Design
**File:** `backend/prisma/schema.prisma`

- ✅ Updated `askDriverRequest` table with negotiation fields:
  - `estimatedDistance` - Calculated total distance (km)
  - `estimatedPrice` - Initial calculated price (distance × rate)
  - `currentAmount` - Current negotiated amount
  - `customerNote` / `driverNote` - Notes from each party
  - `nearestPickupCityName` / `nearestDropCityName` - City names for display
  - `lastModifiedBy` - Track who made last change ('customer' or 'driver')
  - `negotiationHistory` - JSON array of all negotiation steps
  - Added indexes for performance (customerID, driverId, status)

- ✅ Updated `askStatus` enum:
  ```prisma
  enum askStatus {
    PENDING          // Initial request sent
    DRIVER_COUNTER   // Driver made counter-offer
    CUSTOMER_COUNTER // Customer counter-offered
    ACCEPTED         // Both parties agreed
    REJECTED         // Request rejected
    ASSIGNED         // Moved to ChildRideRequest/StaffRideRequest
  }
  ```

### 2. Backend Module Created
**Location:** `backend/src/driver-request/`

#### DTOs Created (`dto/`)
- ✅ `create-request.dto.ts` - For creating new requests
- ✅ `respond-request.dto.ts` - For driver responses (ACCEPT/REJECT/COUNTER)
- ✅ `counter-offer.dto.ts` - For customer counter-offers
- ✅ `request-response.dto.ts` - Standard response format with negotiation history

#### Service Methods (`driver-request.service.ts`)
- ✅ `createRequest()` - Create new ride request with distance/price calculation
- ✅ `getCustomerRequests()` - Fetch customer's sent requests (with status filter)
- ✅ `getDriverRequests()` - Fetch driver's received requests (with status filter)
- ✅ `customerCounterOffer()` - Customer counter-offers driver's price
- ✅ `driverRespond()` - Driver accepts/rejects/counters request
- ✅ `acceptRequest()` - Either party accepts current offer
- ✅ `rejectRequest()` - Either party rejects request
- ✅ `assignRequest()` - Transfer accepted request to ChildRideRequest/StaffRideRequest
- ✅ `calculateEstimatedDistance()` - Calculate total trip distance
- ✅ `calculatePrice()` - Calculate monthly price (distance × Rs. 15 × 26 days)

#### API Endpoints (`driver-request.controller.ts`)
- ✅ `POST /driver-request/create` - Create new request
- ✅ `GET /driver-request/customer/:customerId` - Get customer's requests
- ✅ `GET /driver-request/driver/:driverId` - Get driver's requests
- ✅ `POST /driver-request/:id/counter-offer` - Customer counters
- ✅ `POST /driver-request/:id/respond` - Driver responds
- ✅ `POST /driver-request/:id/accept` - Accept offer
- ✅ `POST /driver-request/:id/reject` - Reject request
- ✅ `POST /driver-request/:id/assign` - Assign to ride table

#### Module Registration

- ✅ Added to `app.module.ts` imports

### 3. Documentation Created
- ✅ `RIDE_REQUEST_NEGOTIATION_FEATURE.md` - Complete feature documentation
- ✅ `RIDE_REQUEST_IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md` - This status file

## ⏳ Pending Tasks

### 1. Database Migration
**STATUS:** Schema updated but not migrated

**CRITICAL:** The database migration must be run before the backend can function:

```powershell
cd "d:\Group Project 2\YathraGo\backend"
npx prisma migrate dev --name add_ride_request_negotiation_fields
npx prisma generate
```

**Note:** There's a drift issue because migrations directory is empty but database has tables. You may need to baseline:
1. Create migration without applying: `npx prisma migrate dev --create-only`
2. Manually review and apply
3. Or use `npx prisma db push` for development (not recommended for production)

### 2. Backend Fixes Required
Once migration runs, fix these TypeScript issues in `driver-request.service.ts`:

1. **Import askStatus enum** - Line 4 currently errors
   - The enum will be available after Prisma generates client
   
2. **Staff_Passenger unique key** - Multiple places use `staff_id`
   - Check schema for correct unique field name
   - May need to use `staffPassenger_id` or another field
   
3. **Include clauses** - `User` relation doesn't exist on Customer/Driver
   - Verify relationship names in schema
   - May need different include structure

### 3. Frontend Implementation - Customer App

#### 3.1 Remove Request Button from Vehicle List
**File:** `mobile-customer/app/(menu)/(homeCards)/find_vehicle.tsx`

Remove:
- `requestedMap` state
- `handleRequestVehicle` function  
- Request button from VehicleCard component

#### 3.2 Add Request Feature to Transport Overview
**File:** `mobile-customer/app/(menu)/(homeCards)/transport_overview.tsx`

Add new section below tabs:
```typescript
<View className="p-4 bg-white">
  <Text className="text-lg font-bold mb-2">Request Ride</Text>
  
  <View className="flex-row justify-between mb-2">
    <Text>Estimated Distance:</Text>
    <Text className="font-bold">{estimatedDistance} km</Text>
  </View>
  
  <View className="flex-row justify-between mb-2">
    <Text>Estimated Monthly Price:</Text>
    <Text className="font-bold">Rs. {estimatedPrice}</Text>
  </View>
  
  <TextInput
    placeholder="Your Offer (Rs.)"
    value={offeredAmount}
    onChangeText={setOfferedAmount}
    keyboardType="numeric"
  />
  
  <TextInput
    placeholder="Note for driver (optional)"
    value={customerNote}
    onChangeText={setCustomerNote}
    multiline
  />
  
  <TouchableOpacity onPress={handleSendRequest}>
    <Text>Send Request</Text>
  </TouchableOpacity>
</View>
```

Need to:
1. Fetch distance/price when component loads
2. Handle send request action
3. Show loading/success/error states

#### 3.3 Create API File
**File:** `mobile-customer/lib/api/driver-request.api.ts` (NEW)

Implement:

- `rejectRequest()` - Reject request

#### 3.4 Create Find Driver Menu
**File:** `mobile-customer/app/(menu)/find-driver.tsx` (NEW)

Two options menu:
1. **Find New Vehicle** → Navigate to `find_vehicle.tsx`
2. **View Sent Requests** → Navigate to `request-list.tsx`

#### 3.5 Create Request List Screen
**File:** `mobile-customer/app/(menu)/find-driver/request-list.tsx` (NEW)

Display list of all requests with:
- Driver name and vehicle
- Current status badge (Pending, Driver Counter, etc.)
- Current offered amount

- Action buttons based on status:
  - **PENDING**: Cancel
  - **DRIVER_COUNTER**: Accept / Counter / Reject
  - **ACCEPTED**: View details only
  - **REJECTED**: View reason

### 4. Frontend Implementation - Driver App

#### 4.1 Replace Mark Attendance Card in Home
**File:** `mobile-driver/app/(tabs)/index.tsx`

Replace attendance card with:
```typescript
<TouchableOpacity onPress={() => router.push('/requests/request-list')}>
  <View className="bg-blue-500 p-4 rounded-lg">
    <Text className="text-white text-lg font-bold">View Ride Requests</Text>
    {pendingCount > 0 && (
      <Text className="text-white">{pendingCount} pending requests</Text>
    )}
  </View>
</TouchableOpacity>
```

#### 4.2 Create Request List Screen
**File:** `mobile-driver/app/requests/request-list.tsx` (NEW)

## Key Formulas

### Distance Calculation
```
Total Distance = 
  distance(Pickup Location → Nearest Driver City from Pickup) +
  distance(Nearest Driver City from Pickup → Nearest Driver City from School/Work) +
  distance(Nearest Driver City from School/Work → School/Work Location)
```

Uses Turf.js Haversine formula for point-to-point distance.

### Price Calculation
```
Estimated Monthly Price = Distance (km) × Rs. 15 × 26 days
```

Constants:
- `PRICE_PER_KM_PER_DAY` = Rs. 15
- `AVERAGE_WORKING_DAYS_PER_MONTH` = 26

## Negotiation Flow

```
1. Customer views vehicle in transport_overview
   ↓
2. Sees estimated distance & price, can modify offer
   ↓
3. Clicks "Send Request" → Status: PENDING
   ↓
4. Driver receives request
   ↓
5. Driver Options:
   - Accept → Status: ACCEPTED → Assign to ride table
   - Reject → Status: REJECTED → End
   - Counter → Status: DRIVER_COUNTER
   ↓
6. If Driver Countered:
   Customer sees counter-offer
   ↓
7. Customer Options:
   - Accept → Status: ACCEPTED → Assign to ride table
   - Reject → Status: REJECTED → End
   - Counter → Status: CUSTOMER_COUNTER → Back to step 5
```

Negotiation continues iteratively until:
- One party accepts → Create ride entry
- One party rejects → End negotiation

## Negotiation History JSON Format

```json
[
  {
    "offeredBy": "customer",
    "amount": 9000,
    "note": "Can you do this price?",
    "timestamp": "2025-01-15T10:30:00Z",
